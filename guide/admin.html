Names and short names are free to modify however even for existing clients.</p> <p>For creating a client you have to specify a template client. You can take any existing client; best of course is a client that is as similar as possible to the new client. You can copy basic data from the template client by using the options Copy informations?, Copy chart of accounts? and Copy reports?.</p> <p>If the numbers in the chart of accounts must obey a certain &quot;pattern&quot; you can specify this pattern on the input field Account number pattern. Whenever you enter an account number in any of the Final programs the system will check the number against this pattern and will complete the number if there is a unique match with an existing account.</p> <p>Possible characters for building patters are:</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image002.png" alt="Characters"></p> <p>Start of fiscal year defines the earliest possible date for a journal entry and the fiscal year itself: The year component of this date is the fiscal year; e.g. with a start date of &quot;01.10.2015&quot; you get 2015 as the fiscal year. For overlong fiscal &quot;years&quot; that are longer than a calendar year you don't have to configure anything special; just set/leave the start of the fiscal year accordingly.</p> <p>You must specify the Base currency already when creating the client, and you cannot change it anymore later.</p> <p>The list of VAT codes that the client will use depends on the Domicile that you specify. If there are no VAT codes listed for the domicile in the master code list the VAT codes of the template client will be copied.</p> <p>You have to declare clients that are subject to VAT as such by setting the Subject to VAT? checkbox. The programs will then fill VAT info when you create journal entries.</p> <p>You can define a Print language for a client. You refer to this language by using the language selection mode Client language (part of the Standard options of every program that prints.)</p> <p>On Voucher number you can set the way voucher numbers are assigned when creating journal entries. A new journal entry will get the value of Last voucher number plus 1. Thus if you want the voucher numbers for your new client to start e.g. with 1000, enter 999 on this field when creating the client.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image003.png" alt="Manage Clients"></p> <h3 id="new-valor-client"><a href="#new-valor-client" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> New Valor Client</h3> <p>You create a new Valor client with the help of the program Manage Clients in program group Clients.</p> <p>Use the same number for the Valor client as for the Final client created beforehand.

For the correct copying of basic data from the template client to the new one do not check Copy client-specific data?. Do check Copy current accounts?.</p> <p>Start of fiscal year defines the date range for transactions: The date is the earliest possible date for a transaction.</p> <p>You have to specify a Domicile; among other things, the domicile selects refund rates when recording transactions.</p> <p>The National currency will usually be CHF. The system will then use CHF for calculating cross exchange rates whenever direct cross rates are not available. You have to import exchange rates with CHF as base currency for this to work. If you want to work with exchange rates with USD as their base currency instead you can use USD as national currency instead of CHF.</p> <p>You can define a Sector code scheme to be used as standard for this client. You use sector code schemes e.g. in certain reports or for sector-wise performance calculation. For this to work you have to assign a sector code from this scheme to each security that the client will hold.</p> <p>You can configure the client to use a certain transaction set. With the field Transaction set empty the system will use the standard transaction set.</p> <p>Check the option Calculate FIFO? if the realizations for all sell and buy transactions in this client should be posted according to the FIFO (&quot;first in, first out&quot;) principle.</p> <p>You can define a Print language for a client. You refer to this language by using the language selection mode Client language (part of the Standard options of every program that prints.)</p> <p>In the frame Accounting you configure the interface from Valor to Final, how voucher numbers are assigned and which currency will be the base currency.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image004.png" alt="Manage Clients"></p> <h3 id="new-emcal-client"><a href="#new-emcal-client" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> New Emcal Client</h3> <p>You create a new Emcal client with the help of the program Manage Clients in program group Clients.</p> <p>Use the same number for the Emcal client as for the Final and Valor clients created beforehand.

You can then complete and/or modify this data for this particular client. It's thus important that you choose a suitable template client for your new client, and likewise important that the data in the template clients is correct and appropiate. Otherwise you waste your time adjusting the same things over and over again for each new client.</p> <p>The tables below summarize the configurations and the ways you can change them:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Final Configuration</th> <th>Program to Modify</th> <th>Remarks</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Chart of accounts</td> <td>Manage Chart of Accounts</td> <td>If the template client is configured as a master client in document MasterKontPlan there will be a one-time conversion of currencies: Any account with the base currency of the master client will be switched to the base currency of the new client.</td></tr> <tr><td>Reports and informations</td> <td>Manage Reports<br><br>Manage Information List</td> <td>Once copied from the template client you can modify reports and informations individually and independently for the new client.

(Such a document has nothing to do with text documents as written e.g. with Microsoft Word.)</p> <p>Some documents are visible to users, e.g. as lists of possible codes in lenses on input fields. Other documents are invisible in the background, containing parameters that are consulted by programs as they run.</p> <p>There is a system program called Document Editor that can be used to modify the content of a document. It's available through the function Document Editor in menu Office.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image006.png" alt="Menu office"></p> <p>Documents are not stored as separate files, but as parts of files like e.g D000Vrdk.DAT. To modify a document after starting the editor directly you have to know the file and the name of the document.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image007.png" alt="Open Doc"></p> <p>For a document that is visible on an input field in some program, there is a much easier way however: Start the program, navigate the cursor to the field and press F2 (shortcut for function Associated record in menu Help.)</p> <p>There is a large number of documents in Moneysoft, with many different kind of data and roles. It would go much too far to describe them all here; if in doubt, please consult Megos.</p> <h3 id="deposits"><a href="#deposits" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Deposits</h3> <p>The list of deposits is a central peace of Valor configuration data. It's important to define the list correctly already early on because many other kind of data like the client-specific data for securities will depend on them. Deposit IDs with up to 5 characters are part of the primary key in a number of important data tables like the one for transactions, and once used you cannot change a deposit number anymore.</p> <p>Beside its ID a deposit also has a name. You can freely change the name. So, if you have a deposit with ID &quot;UBS&quot; and name &quot;UBS&quot; as well, you could change the name to &quot;UBS Geneva Branch&quot; later without problems, but not the ID to &quot;UBSGV&quot;.</p> <p>The list of deposits is client-specific. If you create a new Valor client, its initial deposit lists comes from the template client. After this you can change it independently. The list is stored in document Depotstelle in file DxxxMadk.DAT (with &quot;xxx&quot; the three-digit client number).</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image008.png" alt="Deposits"></p> <h3 id="current-accounts"><a href="#current-accounts" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Current Accounts</h3> <p>Curret accounts can be used to link transactions to balance sheet accounts in Final. The program Record Transactions will use data for current accounts to propose default values for the FA accounts to use. You can e.g. configure that all income goes to a CHF account at UBS but that money from buy and sell transactions goes to accounts with the currency of issue of the security in question.</p> <p>New clients start with a copy of the current account list of the template client. There are a number of reasons to modify this list:</p> <ul><li>The client switches to another bank</li> <li>The client restructures his or her deposits</li> <li>The client does not strictly use accounts in transaction currency</li></ul> <p>In program Manage Current Accounts in program group Basic Data you can use 3 different criteria Deposit, Type of transaction and Security type to define when a given current account should be taken.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image009.png" alt="Current Accounts"></p> <p>By using these flexible criteria you can achieve a very high degree of automatization in program Record Transactions which will automatically default to all the right accounts for all kinds of transactions. It's still possible to manually change accounts in special cases of course.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image010.png" alt="Record Transactions"></p> <h3 id="account-assignments"><a href="#account-assignments" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Account Assignments</h3> <p>An account assignment defines which FA accounts are used for posting the various amounts resulting from a transaction. Like with other configuration data a new client starts with a copy of the account assignments defined in the template client used, but later on you can modify them independently for each client.</p> <p>You find them in document Kontierung in file DxxxMadk.DAT, with &quot;xxx&quot; standing for the client number.</p> <p>You find general info about how to modify a document such as this one in chapter 2.1.</p> <p>A possibility to use the F2 shortcut into the document editor with this document is the field Account assignment in program Manage Client-Specific Data in program group Basic Data.</p> <p>Usually you work with one account assignment per security account, so that cost value and profit/loss can go to different FA accounts.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image011.png" alt="Account Assignments"></p> <h2 id="securities-traders-and-stamp-duty"><a href="#securities-traders-and-stamp-duty" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Securities Traders and Stamp Duty</h2> <h3 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Introduction</h3> <p>All the following refers to the circular Kreisschreiben Nr. 12 of the Swiss Federal Tax  Administration from March 10, 2011. It only applies to clients which are securities traders (&quot;Effektenhändler&quot;) in the sense of this circular.</p> <p>If a securities trader registers with his Swiss trading partner, i.e. the bank, that bank will not charge stamp duty for transactions because it is the obligation of the securities trader calculate and pay the stamp duty. Some banks, howewer, offer the service of calculation and payment. In this case, the .</p> <p>Somebody with securities trader status has the following obligations:<br>
a)  To collect stamp duty for any asset management activity for Swiss parties without involvement of a bank<br>
b)  To collect stamp duty for any direct business with foreign brokers and banks (delivery versus payment to the Swiss correspondent bank)<br>
c)  To document any stamp duty that was directly collected by a Swiss bank<br>
d)  To calculate and report a differential payment each quarter</p> <p>It's possible that this differential payment amounts to 0: That's the case when all transactions of a given quarter were of type c) and correctly settled in regard to stamp duty. The report then documents all the transactions subject to stamp duty and states the Swiss party collecting the duty for each of them.</p> <p>The Valor program Print Transfer Tax Register in program group Reports is able to produce such a report. Based on transaction codes it only selects transactions that involve stamp duty. (Currently, the system has to rely on transaction codes because it does not know whether the traded securities as such are subject to stamp duty or not.)</p> <h3 id="requirements"><a href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Requirements</h3> <p>The mentioned program Print Transfer Tax Register will only generate a correct report if a number of requirements are met:</p> <h4 id="complete-list-of-processing-banks"><a href="#complete-list-of-processing-banks" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Complete List of Processing Banks</h4> <p>An important requirement is the availability of all necessary processing banks and brokers in each client that represents a securities trader.

(The user calculates the amount himself, there is no automatism.)</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image014.png" alt="Record Trx"></p> <h4 id="configuration-of-transaction-codes"><a href="#configuration-of-transaction-codes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Configuration of Transaction Codes</h4> <p>As already mentioned the program Print Transfer Tax Register relies on transaction codes to know whether a transaction is relevant regarding stamp duty or not.</p> <p>In program Manage Transaction Definitions in program group Utilities the corresponding transaction codes must be configured as follows: In the frame Consider in reports there must be an entry 2487 Transfertax register with the checkbox set:</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image015.png" alt="Transaction set"></p> <h3 id="report-generation-and-corrections"><a href="#report-generation-and-corrections" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Report Generation and Corrections</h3> <p>The program Print Transfer Tax Register in program group Reports is used to generate the report. The report prints its results into a Excel file. Not everything is fully automated; you have to check that Excel file and manually correct some things in the file as follows:</p> <ul><li>If a transaction uses one of the transaction codes configured for stamp duty according to the previous chapter 3.2.3, but the traded security itself is exempted from stamp duty, that transaction will be in the report erroneously: Delete all lines for such transactions from the report (e.g. if used 11 for buy of money market call money).</li> <li>There is no duty necessary on particularly instruments, which contain a choice/option. E.g.  Warrants, Options, Futures, Calls und Puts and the like. Short term investments such as fiduciary accoutns, Money Market Funds, Credits/Loans are exempt of duty, too.</li> <li>With transactions that are processed through a foreign bank or broker there is no entry into the comments column: (Bemerkungen/Comments) but you must enter the whole gross turnover in the relevant column for domestic/foreign security (in-/ausl. Titel). This can be done by Moving the amount from the existing report cell to the relevant cell domestic/foreign for the same line.</li> <li>One needs to amend the calculation totals by enterring a formula in int the sum/total cells: Domestic Total * 0.075%: Foreign Total *0.15%. The page totals and summ cells need a fine tuning, too.  The overal total of the domestic securities plus the overall total of the foreign securities x 0.15% have to match with the balance of the account Stamp Duty.</li></ul> <p>There is special care to be taken for the column “Comments”.</p> <p>With transactions that are processed with a Swiss bank, the short key for that particular bank will be entered manually into the EXCEL, e.g. CSZRH, UBSZRH. Both amounts are to be entered as „nicht pflichtig“ (no duty) as the amounts are transferred by the processing bank.</p> <p>Big differences are to be analysed and are to be corrected in either adding Transactions of 22, correcting masterdata of brokers, adding execution brokers to the transactions or other measurments.</p> <h2 id="specifications"><a href="#specifications" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Specifications</h2> <p>Reports as they are printed by Final and Valor print programs typically have many parameters that influence exactly what is printed, and how. A set of parameter values is called specification. A specification comprises a name, standard options, possibly special options, and possibly selections.</p> <p>Each print program has its own list of specifications. Specifications are client-independent, or in other words valid for all clients.</p> <p>To create a new specification or to modify an existing one you use Edit specification on the field Mode in the print program:</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image016.png" alt="Create Spec"></p> <p>If you enter the name of an existing specification on the field Specification while in this mode, you can modify it. To create a new specification, enter a new name on that field, which will switch the program into Create mode.</p> <p>You can specify or change the main options and the descriptions for the specification on the dialog behind the button Standard Options….</p> <p>The language to use for the report, the sort order for the data to print and the printer to use are among those main options:</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image017.png" alt="Standard Options"></p> <p>The button Special Options… leads to a dialog with more, this time program-specific options. The following screenshot shows a typical special options dialog. Note that sometimes, depending on the print program, standard and special options interact in some way, e.g. there is a special option Print subtotals? to activate subtotals, but the sort order as defined in the standard options decides what is totalled.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image018.png" alt="Options"></p> <p>Part of most specifications are selections which you enter on a dialog behind the button Selections…. Selections are program-specific. With them you can specify conditions that data records have to meet in order to be &quot;selected&quot; and printed.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image019.png" alt="Selections"></p> <h2 id="fa-securities"><a href="#fa-securities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> FA Securities</h2> <h3 id="creating-fa-securities"><a href="#creating-fa-securities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Creating FA Securities</h3> <p>You can include balance values from FA accounts in Valor reports like the one generated by program Print Portfolio as if they were &quot;normal&quot; securities with a balance based on recorded transactions, with the help of so-called FA securities.</p> <p>A security is treated as such if you specify an account group for it with the program Manage Client-Specific Data, on the fields in the frame Account group of its main dialog.</p> <p>Because this artificial security has of course no natural ID like an IBAN or a Valor number use an internal number like e.g. &quot;ZZBAC000000x&quot; for a current account.</p> <p>The account balances are computed as needed at the time of the report; there is no need to export or prepare anything beforehand.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image020.png" alt="FA Sec"></p> <p>On the field Group you specify the account group and thus the accounts that will go into this FA security. The next chapter 5.2 explains how to create or modify account groups.</p> <p>On the field Type you declare the security to be either Capital or Earnings which plays a role when calculating performance.</p> <h3 id="account-groups"><a href="#account-groups" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Account Groups</h3> <p>Account groups are defined in document KontoGruppe in file DxxxMadk.DAT. The easiest way to modify the document is by using the F2 shortcut for entering the program Document Editor with the cursor on field Group in program Manage Client-Specific Data.</p> <p>Each client has its own list of account groups.</p> <p>For a group comprising a single account or a single account range create one entry in this document, giving the desired group number on the field Group.</p> <p>For a group comprising several account ranges create several entries, with identical group number on the field Group, and with the boolean Addieren? set to Y.</p> <p>When creating entries, give your entries appropriate &quot;artificial&quot; key values on the field Key that are required for technical reasons and do not define the groups themselves.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image021.png" alt="Accout Groups"></p> <h2 id="peformance-calculations"><a href="#peformance-calculations" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Peformance Calculations</h2> <h3 id="calculate-performance-data"><a href="#calculate-performance-data" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Calculate Performance Data</h3> <p>The program Calculate Performance Data in program group Reports is the program that calculates performance data, prints it in a simple way and stores it permanently into a database.</p> <p>As a print program it works with specifications like explained in chapter 4, but with the difference that here, as a rare exception, the specifications are per client. Furthermore there is the option Calculate all specifications? that processes all specifications for the active client in one go, with an arbitrary specification with that option set used to start the process.</p> <p>For each specification performance is calculated for aggregates, the so-called total types, and depending on the options set for securities and/or client-specific securities.</p> <p>You can label the data calculated by a specification with a so-called selection method; specify its code on the field Selection method if wanted. The available selection methods are contained in document PerfSelektion in file DxxxMadk.DAT; use the F2 shortcut with the cursor on the field to enter Document Editor if you want to define new selection methods.</p> <p>So by using selections on the dialog behind the button Selections… and labelling the corresponding calculated data with the help of selection methods you can handle performance data for several sub-portfolios; use the names of the selection methods to keep the overview which is which.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image022.png" alt="Performance Selections"></p> <p>The longest possible period for a performance is 1 year.

There is data per period and per security, for all available total types, performances for a day, for a month, for a quarter, for a year and since inception.</p> <p>All these performances are calculated using several methods: TTWR, MWR, Modified Dietz, Money multiplier and IRR annualized.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image024.png" alt="View Performance Data"></p> <h3 id="print-performance-data"><a href="#print-performance-data" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Print Performance Data</h3> <p>You print performance data or export it to Excel with the program Print Performance Data in program group Reports.</p> <h2 id="vat"><a href="#vat" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> VAT</h2> <p>If you create a new Final client its list of VAT codes will be generated based on the domicile given and the VAT code master document. If you specify a domicile that is missing in the master document the VAT code list of the template client will be used.</p> <p>The master document UmsSteMas with VAT codes per domicile is in file D000Fidk.DAT.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image026.png" alt="Document VAT"></p> <p>The boolean option VAT included? sagt ob der Betrag i.d.R. inklusiv oder exklusiv MWST eingegeben wird, dementsprechend wird der Net amount und der Taxable amount gerechnet.</p> <p>The boolean option Net? sagt ob die Netto- oder Brutto Abrechnungsmethode angewendet wird. Wird Brutto-Methode angewendet, wird beim Verbuchen keine MWST Buchung erstellt. Diese wird erstellt with the program Settle Value Added Tax in program group Journal Entries.</p> <p>You can set a default VAT code to be used for journal entries involving a given account in program Manage Chart of Accounts in program group Chart of Accounts, on the field Tax code. There is also an option This tax code exclusively?; if set, no other VAT code will be allowed for this account.</p> <p>With the option All entries with tax? you can force all journal entries for the account to have VAT.</p> <p><img src="/images/admin/image027.png" alt="Manage Chart of Accounts"></p> <p>Example of a net settlement, excluding VAT, with 2 journal entries:</p> <blockquote><p>100000/340000: CHF 925.93<br>
