class="header-anchor">#</a> Valor / Securities Accounting</h1> <p>The icons for the program groups and programs of Valor in the launcher use the color
blue to make them easily recognizable as belonging to Valor.</p> <h2 id="master-data"><a href="#master-data" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Master Data</h2> <h3 id="manage-clients"><a href="#manage-clients" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Clients</h3> <p>Clients in Moneysoft and thus in Valor are identified with numbers in the range 000 to 999.
You manage the clients with the program Manage Clients in program group Clients. The most important parameters of each client are the following:</p> <p>The national currency is important for cross rates: If there is an exchange rate needed for the base currency but unavailable a cross rate will be calculated using the national currency.</p> <p>Different clients can work with different transaction sets i.e. sets of transaction codes. You can set it with the field Transaction set.</p> <p>You can also decide on a client-to-client basis whether the FIFO method will be used for valuations, with the check box Calculate FIFO?.</p> <p>You can specify a client language on the field Print language that will determine the language used for reports if you use the corresponding language selection mode Client language in a report program.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image140.png" alt="Manage Clients"></p> <h3 id="change-client"><a href="#change-client" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Change Client</h3> <p>For each user separately, one of the existing Valor clients is the current client, and all Valor programs automatically use the client that is current at the time of the start of the program. The status bar shows you which client is the current one.</p> <p>You can switch between clients with the program Change Client in program group Clients.</p> <div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Important</p> <p>This program (like its sister programs in Final and Emcal) switches the current client for Final, Valor and Emcal (if installed) simultaneously to keep them in sync. However, all programs that are already running i.e. have windows open do not change the client. To work with the new client you have to terminate and then restart those programs.</p></div> <h3 id="manage-refund-rates"><a href="#manage-refund-rates" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Refund Rates</h3> <p>The program Manage Refund Rates in program group Clients lets you define refund rates that will be used when recording transactions and when calculating deferred income. You start it directly from the program group Clients or from the program Manage Clients by using the button Manage Refund Rates.</p> <p>You can define refund rates globally for a domicile, or for a domicile in connection with a certain client and/or a certain transaction code.</p> <p>You can define the refundable and the non-refundable tax percentages.</p> <p>Check the option Potentially refundable? if there is a double taxation agreement with the domicile and a potentially refundable tax at source; the program Calculate and Print Withholding Tax in program group Valuations will then mark a possible tax refund accordingly.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image142.png" alt="Manage Refund Rates"></p> <h3 id="transaction-sets"><a href="#transaction-sets" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transaction Sets</h3> <p>Transaction sets are distinct sets of transaction codes as managed with the program Manage Transaction Definitions in program group Utilities. They exist to support multiple valuation methods like Expenses part of book value or Expenses in P/L.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image144.png" alt="Manage Definitions"></p> <p>In the program Manage Clients you can define which transaction set the client will use:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image146.png" alt="Define Trx Set"></p> <h3 id="create-consolidated-client"><a href="#create-consolidated-client" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Create Consolidated Client</h3> <p>The program Create Consolidated Client in program group Clients creates a consolidated client by basically copying everything from a number of separate clients into one big client. Later you can update such a consolidated client with the &quot;delta&quot; i.e. all changes that happened in the separate clients since the creation of the consolidated client or the last update.</p> <p>Consolidated clients are the technical mechanism of Valor to allow easy and fast reporting over a number of clients which otherwise would be impossible because most Valor report programs are restricted to one client, the current one.</p> <p>While it's technically possible to modify the data in a consolidated client this usually does not make sense. It's recommended to treat consolidated clients as read-only copies of the original clients that you also can delete and re-create as needed.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image148.png" alt="Create Consolidated Client"></p> <h2 id="basic-data"><a href="#basic-data" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Basic Data</h2> <h3 id="manage-securities"><a href="#manage-securities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Securities</h3> <p>Valor works with a single, global pool of securities that is common to all clients: All securities of all clients are defined here. You manage this pool with the program Manage Securities in program group Basic Data.</p> <p>Securities number together with Postfix defines a unique main key for each security as known to Valor that you cannot change anymore once the security is created.</p> <p>While it's possible to create new securities manually, it's recommended to use the apiD interface to SIX Financial Information (&quot;Telekurs&quot;) whenever possible because the data about securities in the SIX database is of good quality, and it's simply faster.</p> <p>If you enter a securities number that is new to Valor or click the New Through SIX... button you get the following dialog box:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image150.png" alt="Dialog create from SIX"></p> <p>If you answer &quot;Yes&quot; the following dialog lets you define the Valor keys for the new security, in the frame Use for the new security. The info in frame Known key comes from the SIX database and helps you to decide on the keys.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image152.png" alt="New Security Keys"></p> <p>The program tries to propose the correct type of security to use but cannot do so in many circumstances, depending on the particular type list you use for Valor. In such cases you can refer to the various security data from the SIX database that is displayed in the lens below the dialog:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image154.png" alt="SIX Dialog"></p> <p>A security in Valor has a multi-language short name and a multi-language name. Short name and name in the system language are mandatory, but optional in the other languages. However if you want to print reports in those languages and want your securities to appear with names and short names in the report language as well you do need to specify these names here.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image156.png" alt="Security Header"></p> <p>A security has a status with the possible values Verified and Unverified. Newly created securities get a Unverified status to display clearly that someone with the necessary knowledge still needs to check and/or complete the data that came from the SIX database.</p> <p>The lens behind the button Unverified... helps you keeping track.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image158.png" alt="Button Verified"></p> <p>The frame Type of security contains a number of fields with classification data:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image160.png" alt="Type of Security"></p> <p>The frame Miscellaneous contains fields for various other important data about the security:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image162.png" alt="Miscellaneous Fields"></p> <p>The dates given in the Dates frame are important especially for nominal securities, for calculating interest:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image164.png" alt="Interest Fields"></p> <h3 id="manage-client-specific-data"><a href="#manage-client-specific-data" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Client-Specific Data</h3> <p>The program Manage Client-Specific Data in program group Basic Data lets you configure a security as used within the context of a particular client. If needed you can go one step further and include the deposit in the context.</p> <p>The most important data:</p> <ul><li>Base security (more commonly known as underlying)</li> <li>Voucher currency (used as default when recording a transaction)</li> <li>FIFO calculation (for this particular security instead of client-wide)</li> <li>Asset category (used for reports)</li> <li>Account assignment (accounts used when generating journal entries for FA)</li> <li>Alternative stock exchange for getting valuation rates from SIX</li></ul> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image166.png" alt="Manage Client-Specific Data"></p> <h3 id="manage-deposits"><a href="#manage-deposits" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Deposits</h3> <p>Deposits in Valor are mostly used to model safe custody accounts, with as many deposits per client as needed.</p> <p>You manage deposits by pressing the F2 function key in program Manage Client-Specific Data while the cursor is on the field Deposit.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image168.png" alt="Manage Deposits"></p> <p>A new deposit is created by choosing and entering a new code plus a name at least in German and confirming with OK. Unfortunately the new deposit cannot be used right away, but only after a restart of the program.</p> <h3 id="manage-current-accounts"><a href="#manage-current-accounts" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Current Accounts</h3> <p>With the program Manage Current Accounts in program group Basic Data you can define up to 100 current accounts per currency or per currency and deposit. By setting the Type of transaction and/or Security type fields you can use different accounts depending on those criteria, e.g. using two separate current accounts for Buy and Sell transactions.</p> <p>Current accounts are used for proposing account defaults when recording transactions and FECs.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image170.png" alt="Manage Current Accounts"></p> <h3 id="manage-account-assignments"><a href="#manage-account-assignments" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Account Assignments</h3> <p>An account assignment is a list of FA accounts that play a role for a particular type of transaction, stored under a three-digit numerical code.</p> <p>You create or modify an account assignment by pressing the F2 function key in program Manage Client-Specific Data while the cursor is on the field Account assignment. Unfortunately the new account assignment cannot be used right away, but only after a restart of the program.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image172.png" alt="Manage Account Assignments"></p> <h3 id="fa-securities"><a href="#fa-securities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> FA Securities</h3> <p>You can include balance values from FA accouts in Valor reports as if they were &quot;normal&quot; securities with a balance based on recorded transactions, with the help of so-called FA securities.</p> <p>A security is treated as such if you specify an account group for it with the program Manage Client-Specific Data, on the fields in the frame Account group of its main dialog:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image174.png" alt="FA Securities"></p> <h3 id="manage-sector-code-schemes"><a href="#manage-sector-code-schemes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Manage Sector Code Schemes</h3> <p>You can work with sector code schemes (also known as industry classification schemes) in Valor, using codes with up to 3 levels of hierarchy main group / group / subgroup and optional external codes. You manage the schemes with the program Manage Sector Code Schemes in program group Basic Data:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image176.png" alt="Manage Sector Codes"></p> <h3 id="assign-sector-codes"><a href="#assign-sector-codes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Assign Sector Codes</h3> <p>You tell which security belongs to which sector by using sector codes from your sector

The security itself must exist already in order to use it here; if there is no client-specific data yet for the security in the current client it will be automatically created, using configured defaults e.g. for the account assignment. You check and modify that data in program Manage Client-Specific Data in program group Basic Data.</p> <p>Transaction code: Use the appropriate code, e.g. 11 for a buy or 41 for a sale. Some other fields are open or closed for entering values depending on the particular transaction code used.</p> <p>Date: Use the same date for Trade date and Voucher date. The voucher date will be used for the generated FA journal entries.</p> <p>Settlement amount: Use net amounts in the currency of the current account used. The exchange rate of the settlement currency to the base currency of the current client will apply.</p> <p>Description: The program generates a default transaction description depending on the transaction code given that you can modify as needed.</p> <p>Rate curr. of issue: The program proposes the current exchange rate of the currency of issue of the security to the base currency of the client; modify as needed.</p> <p>Rate of security: You must give the valuation rate in the currency of issue of the security which will be displayed to the left of this field.

As a new feature you can configure (for each client individually, if necessary) that FA entries are created earlier i.e. already when you record transactions.</p> <p>The FA entries created this way are called pre-entries. Pre-entries technically are similar to unposted journal entries, and you can look at them with the same program Create Jounal Entries, but you can't modify them like normal unposted journal entries, and you cannot post them in Final.</p> <p>The Valor program Record Transactions will keep corresponding pre-entries in sync with all changes you make, whether you record new transactions, modify or delete them.</p> <p>If you post the transactions their pre-entries will be posted as well. After this those FA entries will be normal posted journal entries, with nothing indicating that they started as pre-entries.</p> <p>Not only the program Record Transactions will create pre-entries and keep them in sync if configured to do so, but all other programs that somehow create transactions as well, e.g. the program Record Forward Exchange Contracts.</p> <p>Many Final and Valor programs that generate reports have an option to include or exclude unposted journal entries. That same option now includes or excludes pre-entries as well.</p> <p>In lenses, where unposted journal entries are marked with &quot;F&quot;, pre-entries are marked with &quot;P&quot;:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image190.png" alt="Pre-Entries"></p> <h3 id="check-before-post"><a href="#check-before-post" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Check Before Post</h3> <p>The program Post Transactions in program group Transactions is able to do trial runs and just print exactly what would result if transactions were posted, but without actually posting anything.

Then click on the Cancel... button (top right corner of the dialog).</p> <p>The following dialog box appears:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image200.png" alt="Dialog Cancelation"></p> <p>Clicking the arrow icon of the drop-down box or pressing the F3 key brings up a lens with all transactions of the given security. Select the transaction to cancel in this lens. (The input field itself currently has no function, don't enter any number here.)</p> <p>The result is a number of new and as yet unposted transactions. The first is a cancel transaction to &quot;negate&quot; the selected transaction itself; you see that this is a cancel transaction by the display of <em><strong>CANCELATION</strong></em> left to the ID field.</p> <p>The second new, as yet unposted transaction is a copy of the canceled transaction. The idea behind this: Probably you cancel a transaction because it's wrong somehow, e.g. with a wrong amount, not because you want to delete it outright without any replacement. So now you can modify this copy which is easier than re-starting from zero.</p> <p>If you do want to &quot;delete&quot; a transaction i.e. cancel it without replacing it somehow just delete this copy.</p> <p>Any transactions for the security that took place after the one to cancel will be canceled and immediately reposted: For each such transaction you get two new unposted transactions, one to cancel and one to repost. (Do not change those repost transactions in any way.)</p> <p>The idea behind this: The canceled transaction can influence transactions that follow it, especially as far as FA amounts for profit/loss are concerned. Instead of generating FA journal entries that merely book resulting differences which would be hard to understand later it's better to cancel and repost everything.</p> <p>A few more points about canceling: As an exception to the usual rules about unposted transactions normal users are not allowed to delete a cancel transaction; once they created one they have to go through and post it later. An attempt to delete such a transaction leads to the following error dialog box:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image202.png" alt="Dialog Not Allowed to Delete"></p> <p>If you have at least Superuser privileges (and thus know all the details, it's assumed) you get to decide about the fate of the transactions that follow the transaction to cancel, because canceling and reposting those is unnecessary in certain circumstances:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image204.png" alt="Dialog Cancel all Following Transacitons"></p> <p>And finally: Nothing is really canceled until the transactions are posted.</p> <h3 id="working-with-prerecorded-transactions"><a href="#working-with-prerecorded-transactions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Working With Prerecorded Transactions</h3> <p>Moneysoft has a pool for so-called prerecorded transactions.

Prerecorded transactions &quot;wait&quot; in their own pool separate from the pool of normal unposted transactions as managed by the program Record Transactions until their time has come.</p> <p>Prerecorded transactions are mostly generated automatically based on dividend data (see the chapter about program Manage Dividends), but there is also the program Prerecord Transactions in program group Transactions where you can create such transactions manually if needed.</p> <p>Prerecorded transactions can't be posted directly: You have to &quot;take them over&quot; in program Record Transactions i.e. let the system create unposted transactions based on the prerecorded data and delete the prerecorded transactions afterwards.</p> <p>There is the following mechanisms: If the program detects matching prerecorded transactions after you specify security and transaction code it offers you take them over by displaying the following dialog box:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image206.png" alt="Dialog Prerecordered Transactions"></p> <p>After answering with &quot;Yes&quot; you get a lens listing all matching prerecorded transactions.

If e.g. you have a client that works with mark to market and do your year-end valuation as at 31.12. using market values, at the end of that day, for that client, book value and market value are identical.</p> <p>This chapter tries to make clear which value is which, and show how Moneysoft and Valor in particular deal with the different values.</p> <p>On the most basic level, Moneysoft works with net values and book values respectively. Book value is fundamental for calculating unrealized profit/loss as the difference between book and market value. Book value is influenced by normal transactions, but also by valuation transactions at the end of a period.</p> <h3 id="tabular-overview"><a href="#tabular-overview" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tabular Overview</h3> <table><thead><tr><th></th> <th>Net</th> <th>Gross</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Basic message</td> <td>A client has a net value which is its book value</td> <td>A client has a gross value as a second, alternative value, used to keep track of historical cost values</td></tr> <tr><td>Realization during the period</td> <td>To net value i.e. to the current book value</td> <td>Does not influence realization</td></tr> <tr><td>Book value</td> <td>Net value = book value</td> <td>n/a</td></tr> <tr><td>Cost value</td> <td>In a client without revaluation at end of period (or with book value corrections only in Final) net and gross won't differ, and cost value = book value</td> <td></td></tr> <tr><td>Value changes</td> <td>Every transaction with a code configured as Include if net? is included when calculating net value and thus influences market value</td> <td>Every transaction with a code configured as Include if gross? is included when calculating gross value and thus influences cost value <br><br>Revaluation transactions thus are not to be included here</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>You can see how transaction codes are configured in this respect with program Manage Transaction Definitions in program group Utilities.

As this transaction will take place in the future it does yet belong to the balance sheet; that's why for FECs an account group separate from profit and loss accounts and balance sheet accounts is used, called out of balance (German: Ausserbilanz).</p> <p>The journal entries for those out of balance accounts resulting from the opening of the FEC record exactly the buy and sell amounts and remain unvalued until the FEC is liquidated. For FECs you will work with 3 out of balance accounts per currency, one for the receivables, one for the payables, and one for the valuations.</p> <p>If you value FECs (see chapter Valuations) Moneysoft uses the forward rates to calculate the difference to the buy amount (the unrealized profit/loss).</p> <p>It won't post this to the accounts for the receivables and the payables, but to the separate valuation account: A valuation will result in a journal entry for the valuation account; its amount will be the difference between the current profit/loss and the profit/loss at the time of the last valuation, to bring the balance of the valuation account to the current profit/loss.</p> <p>To value FECs forward exchange rates are needed for each occuring currency, possibly client-specific. Moneysoft will calculate missing rates by using interpolation. Example: The forward rates 1W, 1M, 2M, 3M and 1Y are present, but a rate 4 months out is needed. Moneysoft will take the 3M and 1Y rates and interpolate a rate 4 months in the future.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p> <p>If you work with spot deals when rolling over FECs it's recommended to treat those deals technically like FECs although they aren't of course.

The program calculates and proposes a voucher date as maturity date minus 2 working days, as per convention for FECs:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image246.png" alt="Liquidation FEC"></p> <p>(The resulting liquidation transaction gets the maturity date of the FEC as value date, voucher date as entered here, and trade date identical to voucher date.)</p> <p>After you confirm with &quot;Yes&quot; the program creates the security behind the FEC, including client-specific data, an opening transaction and possibly a liquidation transaction, both unposted.</p> <div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Important</p> <p>The liquidation transaction will stay unposted at least until its trade date is reached; the program Post Transactions will only process liquidation transactions if trade date &lt;= current date. (Other types of transactions in the future are posted right away, however.)</p></div> <p>If you have to record a FEC for a new currency pair you have to complete its basic data yourself; the program will just propose default values for Type and Unit:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image248.png" alt="Basic Data FEC"></p> <p>In frame Transaction information enter the currencies and the amounts. The program will calculate the exchange rate:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image250.png" alt="FEC Transaction Infos"></p> <p>If you already defined an account assignment for the currency pair of the FEC earlier you can select it to fill the account number fields in the frame Account info with the correct values. The fields show you which accounts are needed. You will need a transitory account if both currencies differ from the base currency of the client.</p> <p>In the case of a FEC for a new currency pair you probably won't have an assignment yet however; in this case use a new number on the field Account assignment, name the assignment on the following field, enter all the account numbers, and the program will create a new account assignment accordingly. (The numbers for the current accounts will default to values defined in program Manage Current Accounts in program group Basic Data.)</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image252.png" alt="FEC Account Infos"></p> <p>You post transactions from FECs by using the specification Post FXF contracts in program Post Transactions in program group Transactions.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p> <p>The opening of a FEC will generate journal entries for the &quot;receivable&quot; and &quot;payable&quot; ouf of balance accounts. Profit and loss handling happens at liquidation.</p></div> <h3 id="valuation"><a href="#valuation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Valuation</h3> <p>You have to actively value FECs if you want them to appear on reports printed by program Print Portfolio, if you need profit/loss data for a given key date or if you need profit data for a performance calculation.</p> <div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Important</p> <p>If there is no valuation between issue date and liquidation date, the system will automatically create one valuation record for the FEC in the database for each working day at the liquidation date at the latest.</p></div> <h3 id="value-open-fecs"><a href="#value-open-fecs" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Value Open FECs</h3> <p>The program that values FECs is Value Forward Exchange Contracts in program group Valuations:</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image254.png" alt="Value Open FEC"></p> <p>This is how to read the resulting report: Our Sale and Our Buy show the contracted amounts. Current Value is as at valuation date, using Current Forward Rate. The difference between current value and the buy amount is unrealized P/L Currency.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image256.png" alt="FEC Report"></p> <h3 id="checking-fec-valuations"><a href="#checking-fec-valuations" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Checking FEC Valuations</h3> <p>As already explained in the previous chapter, the program Value Foreign Exchange
Contracts in program group Valuations stores all calculated valuations into a database.</p> <p>If you merely want to check those valuations later, there is a second program Print Foreign Exchange Contracts in program group Transactions.that does neither calculate nor store anything, but simply brings the current content of that database to paper: It prints lists of all stored valuations within a specified date period.</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image258.png" alt="FEC Report Check"></p> <h3 id="liquidation"><a href="#liquidation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Liquidation</h3> <p>If you opted not to let program Record Foreign Exchange Contracts generate the liquidation transactions together with the opening transactions, you have to generate them later by using the program Liquidate Forward Exchange Contracts in program group Transactions.</p> <p>The principle is the same however: The program will create unposted transactions for each FEC to liquidate according to the date values specified in the dialog which you will have to post later.</p> <p>The program only works on FECs within the current client.</p> <p>Enter the selection values as follows:</p> <p>Value date: The maturity date of the FECs to liquidate</p> <p>Trade date: The voucher date of the FECs to liquidate, as per convention maturity date minus 2 working days</p> <p>Voucher date: Identical to trade date</p> <p>Transaction code: 40</p> <p>Transaction description: Accept the default Close FX Forward</p> <p><img src="/images/screenshot/image260.png" alt="Create Liquidation"></p> <h3 id="cancel-fecs"><a href="#cancel-fecs" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cancel FECs</h3> <p>You cancel FECs in program Record Foreign Exchange Contracts in program group
Transactions. You have two options that you choose by using the corresponding button:</p> <p>Cancel FEC: All transactions, FA journal entries and valuations belonging to the FEC are canceled. After that you can't use the security that represents the FEC anymore; for a new (and corrected) FEC you have to create a new security i.e. use a new postfix.</p> <p>Cancel FEC Liquidation: Only the transactions, FA journal entries and valuations belonging to the liquidation are canceled. The FEC itself i.e. everything belonging to its opening stays as it is, and you can liquidate it again after this.</p> <p>A click on either button will bring up a lens with available FECs where you select the one to cancel.</p> <p>Canceling here works like everything else in Valor: It's only really canceled after you post the resulting unposted transactions.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
